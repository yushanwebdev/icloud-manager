# iCloud Manager

iCloud Manager is a small Mac Menu Bar App that helps you to manage your iCloud Data more efficiently. This will be really helpful to manage your Random Email Addresses that generate under the "Hide my Email" Service more quickly than before.
Also, the best part is you don't have to provide any credentials to our App.
